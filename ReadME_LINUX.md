# Grid Computation Deployment and Management Test

## Objective
🔥 **Objective:** Evaluate the candidate's ability to manage and deploy grid computation systems using Bash scripting and Linux environments, with a focus on Kubernetes and Docker, similar to ArmoniK.

## Project Duration
📅 **Project Duration:** 1 weekend

## Technical Objectives
🚀 **The project should demonstrate mastery of the following points:**
- ✔️ Bash scripting for automation and system management
- ✔️ Linux environment configuration and management (Ubuntu and Red Hat)
- ✔️ Containerization with Docker
- ✔️ Deployment and orchestration using Kubernetes
- ✔️ Grid computation system setup and management
- ✔️ Networking and security considerations in distributed systems
- ✔️ Efficient resource management and scaling strategies
- ✔️ Effective use of Git and GitHub for version control and documentation
- ✔️ Proficiency with Linux command-line tools (`sed`, `cat`, `find`, `tail`, `grep`)

⚠ **This project is designed to be challenging to ensure that candidates have a robust understanding of system deployment and management in distributed environments.**

## 1. Bash Scripting and Linux Management
### 1.1 Bash Scripting
- Write scripts to automate system tasks such as package installation, user management, and service configuration.
- Implement error handling and logging.
- Use `sed`, `cat`, `find`, `tail`, and `grep` to manipulate and search files within scripts.
- Commit scripts to GitHub with clear commit messages.

### 1.2 Linux Environment Configuration
- Configure network settings, firewall rules, and system security.
- Manage services and system updates on Ubuntu and Red Hat.
- Document configurations and commit to GitHub.

## 2. Docker Containerization
### 2.1 Docker Basics
- Create Dockerfiles for application containerization.
- Manage images and containers, including version control and storage optimization.
- Use `grep` to search logs and `tail` to monitor real-time updates in container logs.
- Commit Dockerfiles and related configurations to GitHub.

### 2.2 Docker Compose
- Define multi-container applications using Docker Compose.
- Implement networking and persistent storage solutions.
- Push Docker Compose files to GitHub.

## 3. Kubernetes Orchestration
### 3.1 Kubernetes Setup
- Deploy a Kubernetes cluster using Minikube or kubeadm.
- Implement cluster scaling and monitoring.
- Use `kubectl` commands along with `grep` and `sed` to process and filter outputs.
- Commit Kubernetes configuration files to GitHub.

### 3.2 Application Deployment
- Deploy applications using Kubernetes manifests.
- Manage deployments, services, and ingress configurations.
- Document deployment strategies and commit to GitHub.

## 4. Grid Computation System Deployment
### 4.1 System Architecture
- Design the architecture for a grid computation system with workers and directors.
- Ensure scalability and fault tolerance.
- Provide architecture diagrams and commit them to GitHub.

### 4.2 Deployment Strategy
- Deploy the grid computation system using Kubernetes and Docker.
- Implement monitoring and logging for system health checks.
- Use `tail` to monitor logs and `grep` for filtering log data.
- Commit deployment scripts and monitoring configurations to GitHub.

## 5. Networking and Security
### 5.1 Networking
- Configure Kubernetes networking for inter-pod communication.
- Implement service discovery and load balancing.
- Document network configurations and commit to GitHub.

### 5.2 Security
- Secure the grid computation system using role-based access control (RBAC) in Kubernetes.
- Implement container security best practices.
- Commit security policies and configurations to GitHub.

## 6. Resource Management
### 6.1 Resource Allocation
- Optimize resource allocation in Kubernetes for efficient grid computation.
- Implement autoscaling policies based on workload.
- Document resource management strategies and commit to GitHub.

### 6.2 Performance Testing
- Conduct performance testing to ensure system responsiveness under load.
- Analyze results and optimize configurations.
- Use `grep` to extract performance metrics and `sed` to format data.
- Commit test results and analysis to GitHub.

## 7. Final Instructions
- 🔹 Document all steps and configurations in the README.
- 🔹 Ensure scripts and configurations are platform-independent where possible.
- 🔹 Provide a detailed explanatory report with diagrams of system architecture.
- 🔹 Use GitHub effectively to commit all relevant scripts, configurations, and documentation.
- 🔹 Include clear instructions in the README on how to replicate your setup and results.

⚠ **Good understanding of distributed systems is essential: you must be able to explain your setup and optimization strategies.**

🚀 **Good luck!**
