# Options Pricer for Index (S&P 500) in C++

## Objective
🔥 **Objective:** Evaluate the candidate's ability to develop a European options pricer for stock indices (e.g., S&P 500) by combining several advanced techniques in quantitative finance and C++14 programming.

## Project Duration
📅 **Project Duration:** 1 weekend

## Technical Objectives
🚀 **The project should demonstrate mastery of the following points:**
- ✔️ Code structuring and modularity (OOP, error handling, documentation, source file organization)
- ✔️ Optimized implementation of pricing models (Black-Scholes, Monte Carlo, Binomial Tree)
- ✔️ Numerical optimization (lazy evaluation, parallelization, variance reduction)
- ✔️ Retrieval and interpolation of market data (Spot, Implied Volatility, Yield Curve)
- ✔️ Pricing approximation using Machine Learning (neural network)
- ✔️ Comparison of methods in terms of accuracy and computation time
- ✔️ Good project management with Git and GitHub (commit structure, branches, PR)

⚠ **This project is designed to be challenging so that only candidates with a solid background in quantitative finance and programming can succeed.**

## 1. Implementation of Pricing Models
### 1.1 Black-Scholes (Closed-form Formula)
- Implementation without specialized libraries
- Constant dividend or according to the Buhler model
- Vectorized version for efficiency using C++ standard libraries

### 1.2 Monte Carlo with Optimizations
- Implementation without specialized libraries
- Lazy evaluation using generators or iterators
- Antithetic variables, variance reduction
- Random matrix to approximate Greeks
- Parallelization (using C++14 threading or OpenMP)
- Benchmarking of computation time

### 1.3 Binomial Tree (Cox-Ross-Rubinstein)
- Implementation without specialized libraries
- Recursive and vectorized implementation
- Management of continuous or discrete dividends based on your choice
- Comparison in terms of accuracy and speed

## 2. Retrieval of Market Data and Construction of the Risk-Free Rate Curve
### 2.1 Retrieval of Spot and Volatility
- Spot (S0) retrieved via API (using C++ libraries to connect to yfinance, Alpha Vantage, etc.)
- Implied volatility surface and bicubic interpolation

### 2.2 Construction of the Risk-Free Rate Curve
- Retrieval of US Treasury Bond rates via Yahoo Finance, Google Finance, or another source of your choice.
- Cubic spline interpolation of zero-coupon rates
- Implementation with QuantLib or similar for a discounting curve

## 3. Implementation of a Neural Network for Pricing
### 3.1 Training Data
- Use of libraries such as TensorFlow C++ or other ML frameworks
- Inputs: (S0, K, r, σ, T, q)
- Output: Option price
- Dataset: Minimum of 100,000 samples
- Evaluation: RMSE between ML and analytical models

### 3.2 Network Architecture
- MLP with ReLU activation
- Adam optimization with scheduler
- Performance comparison

## 4. Comparison of Methods (sample)
| Method | Option Price | Computation Time (ms) | Error (%) |
|--------|--------------|-----------------------|-----------|
| Black-Scholes | 250.23 | 0.5 | 0.00% |
| Monte Carlo (1000 scenarios) | 249.80 | 120 | -0.17% |
| Monte Carlo (10,000 scenarios) | 250.15 | 950 | -0.03% |
| Binomial Tree (100 steps) | 250.30 | 30 | +0.03% |
| Neural Network | 250.10 | 1.2 | -0.05% |

## 5. Code Organization and Git Best Practices
### 5.1 Code Structure

- 📌 `BlackScholesPricer.cpp` → Implementation of the Black-Scholes formula
- 📌 `BinomialTreePricer.h` → Declaration of the binomial tree pricing class
- 📌 `BinomialTreePricer.cpp` → Implementation of the binomial tree
- 📌 `RiskFreeCurve.h` → Declaration of the yield curve management class
- 📌 `RiskFreeCurve.cpp` → Implementation of the yield curve
- 📌 `VolatilitySurface.h` → Declaration of the volatility interpolation class
- 📌 `VolatilitySurface.cpp` → Implementation of the volatility interpolation

- 📌 `Benchmarking.h` → Declaration of benchmarking functions
- 📌 `Benchmarking.cpp` → Implementation of benchmarking functions

### 5.2 Git & GitHub Requirements
- ✅ Create a public GitHub repository (unless one already exists)
- ✅ Structure commits (avoid generic “fix bug” messages)
- ✅ Use a `main` branch and at least one `feature-X` branch
- ✅ Create a Pull Request before merging `feature` into `main`
- ✅ Add a `.gitignore` to exclude unnecessary files
- ✅ Write a clear README with execution instructions
- ✅ Publish the project on GitHub with a detailed report

## 6. Evaluation Criteria (sample)
| Criterion | Requirements |
|-----------|--------------|
| Code Quality | OOP, documentation, structuring |
| Performance | Vectorization, parallelization |
| Model Accuracy | Rigorous comparison |
| Advanced C++ | OOP, functional programming, parallelization |
| Machine Learning | Performance and accuracy |
| API Usage | Retrieval of rates and volatilities |
| Mastery of Git/GitHub | Structuring commits and branches |

## 7. Final Instructions
- 🔹 The code must be published on GitHub and well-documented.
- 🔹 The project should be completed independently over a weekend.
- 🔹 A detailed explanatory report is required.
- 🔹 No hard-coded market variables in the code; all should come from market data online or previously stored in a database: MySQL, MongoDB, or in a file.

⚠ **Good code alone is not enough: you must be able to explain your choices and compare the methods.**

🚀 **Good luck!**
